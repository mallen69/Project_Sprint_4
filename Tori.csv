For example normally you would learn about the SAS in other classes. Compared to training I received on Acme packet SBCs, I would say this class does not dive deep enough into some of the technical stuff, IE how and why on the configuration, header manipulation, best practices, etc..... I think it would be helpful if maybe there some type of webex or other learning materials students could use to learn BEFORE students attend so time is not wasted on basic things if needed, like how SIP works.
