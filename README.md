Title: Clean "End Of Course Survey” Data / Perform Statistical Analysis and Create PDF Bar Graphs of the Results

Sprint 4 - To write a script in R to clean (tidy) real Survey Monkey End of Course Survey from the collection time period of February 2016 through August 2016 which had been exported as an Excel File.  To change categorical data to numerical data, and perform Mean and Standard Deviation calculations on relevant questions (Columns), and write the data back to a CSV file, and plot the data on a graph and write it to a PDF file. 


As a Technlogy Teacher I need to understand and write basic scripting so that I can save repeatable task of cleaning & tidying of data, and then perform summary statistics including calculating the mean and standard deviation.  I hope to be able to use this code/concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program in the future.


Set the proper working directory in R, read in the Exported Excel Dirty Data from the "Real" End of Course Survey from the dates of February 2016 thru August 2016, collapsed the multiple column names that Survey Monkey created for Instructor into one Instuctor Column name with the "Paste" command, renamed the long Column names with the names command, deleted the extra columns added by Survey Monkey with the subset command, and then exported the R Tidy Data back to a clean CSV file with the write.csv command. All of this was created in an R Script titled Cleaning_the_Excel_Dirty_Data.R  

Things I learned:
No matter how much time or progress I make on a given day/week/or sprint, it still never seems enough.  I need to stop and smell the "code and results" and acknowedge to myself that progress is being made.  And as we know, we are all life long learners so just know there is alway more to learn...
