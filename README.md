Title: Cleaning “Dirty Data” from Excel And Making it “Tidy” in R

Sprint 4 - To write a scrip in R to clean (tidy) real Survey Monkey End of Course Survey from the collection time period of February 2016 through August 2016 which had been exported as an Excel File.  To change categorical data to numerical data, and perform Mean and Standard Deviation calculations on relevant questions (Columns), and write the data back to a CSV file. 

To utilize R to clean (real) Survey Monkey End of Course Survey Data (known as Dirty Data) from the collection time period of (February 2016 through August 2016) which has been exported to R. And then export (write) it back to a CSV file.


As a Technlogy Teacher I need to understand and write basic scripting so that I can save repeatable task of cleaning & tidying of data, and then perform summary statistics including calculating the mean and standard deviation.  I hope to be able to use this code/concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program in the future.


Set the proper working directory in R, read in the Exported Excel Dirty Data from the "Real" End of Course Survey from the dates of February 2016 thru August 2016, and performed previous steps from Sprint three for Cleaning the data. This Sprint and then exported the R Tidy Data back to a clean CSV file with the write.csv command. All of this was created in an R Script titled Cleaning_the_Excel_Dirty_Data.R
